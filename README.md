# Polished Pantry

## Project Description 

Polished Pantry is an app designed to help users take items that are in their pantry and find recipes. Not only are they able to find recipes, but also instructional videos from YouTube. Users can login to their accounts that are stored in Firebase. At this time, anyone who would like to create an account would have to contact the admins (my team that created the app).
